Hello) 
Wine Data Science Project - Analysis Overview


**Context**

The datasets are related to red and white wines of the "Vinho Verde" brand. Due to privacy and logistical issues, only physicochemical (input) and sensory (output) variables are available (e.g., there is no data on grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). Wine information is obtained based on physicochemical tests.

**(Data)**
fixed acidity - fixed acidity (most acids contained in wine are either fixed or difficult to evaporate)

volatile acidity - amount of acetic acid in wine

citric acid - citric acid

residual sugar - amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops

chlorides - amount of salt in wine

free sulfur dioxide - free form of SO2

total sulfur dioxide - total amount of free and bound forms of SO2

density - liquid density

pH - acid-base indicator

sulphates - wine additive from sulfates

alcohol - alcohol percentage

quality (score between 0 and 10) - wine quality

**(Tasks)**
Build several regression models (3-4) predicting wine quality. For each model, create a ranking of the contribution of each feature to the target variable. Select the best model and explain your choice.

Find "anomalous" wines in each class that could be moved to another class without losing the general dependency rules. Explain the reasons that allow such relocation.



This project demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of wine quality data, combining regression modeling, feature importance evaluation, clustering, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and data visualization.

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Red and white wine datasets were loaded from CSV files and combined.
   - A binary feature 'type' was added to distinguish red (0) and white (1) wines.
   - The target variable is 'quality', and all other features are considered predictors.
   - Train-test split was performed (80/20), and scaling (RobustScaler) was applied for regression models.

2. **Regression Modeling**
   - Three models were trained and evaluated: Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBM), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
   - Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV.
   - RÂ² and MSE metrics were calculated to compare model performance.
   - GBM allows direct feature importance extraction, while permutation importance was used for SVR.

3. **Feature Importance**
   - The importance of each feature was visualized using bar plots.
   - This helps to identify which chemical properties of wine contribute most to its quality.

4. **Clustering Analysis**
   - KMeans clustering was applied after StandardScaler normalization.
   - The elbow method suggested 3 clusters.
   - Visualizations include:
     - Scatterplots of alcohol vs volatile acidity colored by cluster.
     - Heatmaps showing mean values of features per cluster.
     - Boxplots comparing wine quality across clusters.
   - PCA was applied for dimensionality reduction:
     - 2D and 3D interactive scatterplots of clusters were generated using Plotly.
     - Graphs are saved as PNG files in the 'plots' folder.

5. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Isolation Forest was used to detect anomalous wines separately for red and white classes.
   - Comparison tables show how anomalies differ from the class mean for all features.
   - This allows identifying unusual wines that may require further investigation.

6. **Note**
   - The analysis includes interactive visualizations and plots that will only display correctly when the code is executed.
   - For full insight, it is recommended to run the code to explore graphs and results dynamically.

The project demonstrates end-to-end workflow in wine data analysis, combining statistical modeling, machine learning, clustering, PCA visualization, and anomaly detection.
